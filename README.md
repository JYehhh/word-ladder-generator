# word-ladder-generator

## Overview. 

This project aims to create a C++ program that generates all possible word ladders between two given words using a lexicon of valid words. A word ladder is a sequence of words, where each word in the sequence is formed by changing a single letter from the previous word, and all the words in the sequence are valid according to the given lexicon. For example, for the words "work" and "play", the valid word ladders are: 

```
work -> fork -> form -> foam -> flam -> flay -> play
work -> pork -> perk -> peak -> pean -> plan -> play
work -> pork -> perk -> peak -> peat -> plat -> play
work -> pork -> perk -> pert -> peat -> plat -> play
work -> pork -> porn -> pirn -> pian -> plan -> play
work -> pork -> port -> pert -> peat -> plat -> play
work -> word -> wood -> pood -> plod -> ploy -> play
work -> worm -> form -> foam -> flam -> flay -> play
work -> worn -> porn -> pirn -> pian -> plan -> play
work -> wort -> bort -> boat -> blat -> plat -> play
work -> wort -> port -> pert -> peat -> plat -> play
work -> wort -> wert -> pert -> peat -> plat -> play
```

## C++ Word Ladder Generator

The word ladder generator consists of the following functions:

**1. read_lexicon:** Reads the lexicon from a file and returns an unordered_set of valid words.

**2. preprocess_lexicon:** Removes all words from the lexicon that have a different length than the source word to optimize the algorithm runtime.

**3. get_neighbour_nodes:** Helper function that finds neighboring words for a given word based on the lexicon and adds them to an adjacency list.

**4. get_word_distances:** Computes the distance of each word from the source word using Breadth-First Search (BFS), and populates the adjacency list through repeated calls to get_neighbour_nodes.

**5. dfs_get_paths:** Recursively called Depth-First Search (DFS) function that generates all paths from the destination to the source word. At each step, the function tries all nodes whose distance is 1 less than the current node's distance.

**6. generate:** Main function that first preprocesses the lexicon, computes word distances using BFS, and then generates all word ladders using DFS. The function returns the generated word ladders sorted alphabetically.


## Implementation

The implementation of the word ladder generator is unique in that it first runs a BFS over the graph of words to tag each word with a distance from the source. Then, it runs a DFS from the destination to the source, trying out nodes that strictly have a distance of 1 less than the current node. The word ladders are generated by traversing the graph and trying out different paths that satisfy the distance constraints. Finally, the generated word ladders are sorted alphabetically and returned.
